# Brewdog App
It's a React app that searches through Brewdog's beer catalogue using their API. Now get looking for your favourite brew, dog! 

# What I used:
•	React
•	JavaScript
•	Sass
•	Enzyme
•	BEM
•	GitHub

# The Brief
The challenge was to build a single page website/application using REACT, which showcased the selection of Brewdog beers catalogued on the Punk API. 

• Use the Punk API to display the beers on a single page, 

• There must be a sidebar that includes both search funtionality (the ability to search for beers by name - with page content updating as each letter is typed) 

• There must also be the ability to filter content on 3 conditions:
    • High Alcohol (ABV value greater than 6%)
    • Classic Range (Was first brewed before 2010)
    • High Acidity (pH lower than 4)

• Style the website as we see fit.

# The Functionality
•	The app itself presents the Brewdog beer catalogue via a display of cards, presented on a responsive grid. 

•	The beer information is fetched from the Punk API and then displayed on each card. The name, tag and image of each card is presented on the front , with the rest of the information presented on the rear via a "view more" button, which was created with useState.

•	The user can search through the catalogue via the search bar and can filter through the beers for specific information

•	The app has also been created to be completely responsive across different sized screens
